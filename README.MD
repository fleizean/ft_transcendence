## Mandatory part

<details>
      <summary> <b> Minimal technical requirement ‚åõ</b></summary>
          <ul>
          <li>‚úÖ The frontend should be developed using pure vanilla <b>Javascript.</b> </li>
          <li>‚åõ Your website must be a <b>single-page application.</b> The user should be able to use the
<b>Back</b> and <b>Forward</b> buttons of the browser. </li>
          <li>‚úÖ Your website must be compatible with the latest stable up-to-date version of
Google Chrome . </li>
          <li>‚åõ The user should encounter no unhandled errors and no warnings when browsing the
website. </li>
          <li>‚åõ Everything must be launched with a single command line to run an autonomous
container provided by Docker. Example : docker-compose up --build </li>
          </ul>
</details>

<details>
      <summary> <b> Game ‚åõ</b></summary>
      The main purpose of this website is to play Pong versus other players.
          <ul>
          <li>‚úÖ Therefore, users must have the ability to participate in a live Pong game against
another player directly on the website. Both players will use the same keyboard.
The <b>Remote players module</b> can enhance this functionality with remote players.</li>
          <li>‚åõ A player must be able to play against another player, but it should also be possible
to propose a <b>tournament.</b> This tournament will consist of multiple players who
can take turns playing against each other. You have flexibility in how you implement
the tournament, but it must clearly display who is playing against whom and the
order of the players. </li>
          <li>‚úÖ A <b>registration system</b> is required: at the start of a tournament, each player
must input their alias name. The aliases will be reset when a new tournament
begins. However, this requirement can be modified using the <b>Standard User
Management module.</b> </li>
          <li>‚åõ There must be a <b>matchmaking system:</b> the tournament system organize the
matchmaking of the participants, and announce the next fight. </li>
          <li>‚úÖ All players must adhere to the same rules, which includes having identical paddle
speed. This requirement also applies when using AI; the AI must exhibit the same
speed as a regular player. </li>
          <li>‚úÖ The game itself must be developed in accordance with the default frontend con-
straints (as outlined above), or you may choose to utilize the <b>FrontEnd module</b>,
or you have the option to override it with the <b>Graphics module.</b> While the visual
aesthetics can vary, it must still capture the essence of the <b>original Pong</b> (1972). </li>
          </ul>
</details>

<details>
      <summary> <b> Security concerns ‚åõ</b></summary>
          <ul>
          <li>‚úÖ Any password stored in your database, if applicable, must be <b>hashed.</b> </li>
          <li>‚úÖ Your website must be protected against <b>SQL injections/XSS.</b> </li>
          <li>‚åõ If you have a backend or any other features, it is mandatory to enable an HTTPS
connection for all aspects (Utilize wss instead of ws...). </li>
          <li>‚úÖ You must implement some form of validation for forms and any user input, either
within the base page if no backend is used or on the server side if a backend is
employed. </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Please make sure you use a strong password hashing algorithm.</b><br>
<b>For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env
variables etc... must be saved locally in a .env file and ignored by
git. Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure
of the project.</b>
